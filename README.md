## Description 

This project created an employee payroll tracker. I learned how to create functions and objects within the functions.

One of the new things I learned was how to use the Math.floor and Math.random. 
I needed to create a function that would give me the name of a random employee, to do that I used the Math.random function and used Math.floor to ensure that I got back a correct value. 


## Usage 
To use this program you would begin by clicking on the add employees button. You are then able to add employees but first and last name as well as their salary. Once you are satisfied with the amount of employees you would like to add you select the okay button when prompted "Are you finished?". In the console you will then see the average salary of your employees and the first and last name of the random drawing winner.
